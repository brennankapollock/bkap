# Engineering Transmission: Project Alpha

**Classification**: PROTOTYPE  
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT  
**Corruption Level**: 12%  

## Signal Detected

This transmission contains specifications for a revolutionary approach to web presence. Traditional portfolios are designed to sell, to convince, to sanitize the creative process.

This system does the opposite.

```javascript
const antiPortfolio = {
  philosophy: "subversion over submission",
  aesthetic: "degradation is intentional",
  navigation: "confusion as feature",
  purpose: "broadcast over browse"
}
```

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with intentional performance quirks
- **Styling**: Tailwind with custom glitch generators  
- **Content**: MDX written on mobile, synced via GitHub webhooks
- **Video**: Degraded loops, CRT simulation, temporal distortion

## Core Principles

1. **Temporal Hauntology**: The past bleeds through digital artifacts
2. **Signal Degradation**: Beauty in broken transmission  
3. **Mobile-First Creation**: Content written in liminal spaces
4. **Anti-SEO**: Invisible to search, visible to seekers
