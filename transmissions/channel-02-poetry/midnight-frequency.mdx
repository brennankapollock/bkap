# Midnight Frequency

*Signal intercepted at 03:33:33*

## The Code Speaks

Between the semicolons  
and the closing braces,  
something breathingâ€”  

Not the machine,  
not the user,  
but the ghost in the gap  
where intention meets execution.  

```
if (dreams == null) {
  return nightmares;
}
```

The cursor blinks  
like a digital heartbeat,  
waiting for instructions  
that never come.  

## Transmission Notes

Written on iPhone at 3 AM, walking through empty streets. The city's WiFi signals bleeding into each other, creating interference patterns that spell out poetry in packet loss.

This is what happens when engineering meets insomnia.
